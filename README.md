## About me
My name is **Cristian**, I live in **Cluj-Napoca**, the heart of Transylvania. I'm a very curious person that has a never ending thirst for knowledge, be it technology, physics, psychology, history or geography. Even though it was hard to pick one, I've found that my passion stands for computers, therefore I decided to pursue a career in **IT**, first as **DevOps / Support Engineer** and later as a programmer with focus on **Web Development**.



## Experience
### 2018 November - 2019 October 
**DevOps / Support Engineer** at **SmartSpot Services SRL**
- Tasked with Monitoring the servers and repairing them in case of software failure
